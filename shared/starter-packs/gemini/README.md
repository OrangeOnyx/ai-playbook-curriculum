# Gemini starter pack

For [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com), Google's assistant. Gemini's persistent configuration lives in **Gems** (custom persistent instructions) and in Google Workspace integration.

## What Gemini gives you to configure

1. **Gems**: named custom instruction sets you can pin to your Gemini sidebar
2. **Workspace context**: Gemini can pull from Drive, Gmail, Calendar when you're signed into your Google account
3. **Extensions**: third-party connectors (varies by tier)

## Files in this pack

## Gotchas

- **Gems apply only when you invoke the Gem.** They don't apply to plain Gemini chats. This is the opposite of ChatGPT's Custom Instructions.
- **Gemini's tier matters.** Pro/Advanced tiers have longer instruction limits and more powerful reasoning. Free tier truncates.
- **Workspace integration is invisible.** Gemini may or may not pull from your Drive on a given query. Don't assume; if you want it consulted, name the file.
- **Voice mode strips formatting.** Your Gem instructions apply, but markdown output becomes spoken prose. Design accordingly if you use voice.
