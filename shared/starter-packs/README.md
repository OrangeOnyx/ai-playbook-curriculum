# Starter packs

Generic, ready-to-copy custom instructions and starter files for the AI platforms most professionals use daily. Each folder is standalone. Copy what you need, replace `<YOUR NAME>`, `<YOUR ROLE>`, and other placeholders, and paste it into the platform.

The philosophy: **give the AI enough context to act like it already knows you, without pretending it does.**

Every pack starts from the same base assumptions:
- You want the AI to be direct, not sycophantic
- You want structured output when it's a task
- You want the AI to say "I don't know" instead of guessing
- You want to keep the persistent asset (your instructions) portable across vendors

The eight packs:

| Platform | What it configures | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| [claude-ai](./claude-ai) | Claude.ai Projects: user profile + project instructions | Web UI settings & project sidebar |
| [claude-code](./claude-code) | `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/commands/` | Your repo |
| [anthropic-console](./anthropic-console) | System-prompt patterns for API/SDK usage | Your code |
| [chatgpt](./chatgpt) | ChatGPT Custom Instructions + Projects | Web UI settings |
| [perplexity](./perplexity) | Perplexity Computer memory + custom skill starter | Your account |
| [cursor](./cursor) | `.cursorrules` and `.cursor/rules/` | Your repo |
| [grok](./grok) | Grok custom instructions | Web UI settings |
| [gemini](./gemini) | Gemini Gems | Web UI |

## Fastest path: bootstrap.sh

For Cursor and Claude Code (the two IDE/CLI targets), one command installs the right files in the right places:

```bash
# from your project root, using a checkout of this repo:
bash /path/to/ai-fluency-program/shared/starter-packs/bootstrap.sh

# or without a checkout:
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OrangeOnyx/ai-fluency-program/master/shared/starter-packs/bootstrap.sh)
```

It auto-detects Cursor (via `.cursor/` or `.cursorrules`) and Claude Code (via `.claude/` or `CLAUDE.md`). For web-based tools (Claude.ai, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Grok, Gemini, Anthropic Console) it prints paste-ready contents to stdout. Any existing files are backed up with a `.bak.<timestamp>` suffix before being overwritten. The script is idempotent and never deletes.

See `bash bootstrap.sh --help` for flags (`--target`, `--print`, `--dry-run`, `--list`).

## Manual: how to actually use these

**Step 1: Pick one platform to start.** Don't try to configure all 8 at once. Start with the one you use most, get value from it, then port the pattern.

**Step 2: Read the platform's README.** Each pack explains the platform's specific quirks (e.g., ChatGPT truncates custom instructions at 1500 chars; Claude Code auto-invokes agents by description match).

**Step 3: Copy the base template.** Replace placeholders. Don't add complexity you don't need yet.

**Step 4: Iterate.** Every 2 weeks, ask yourself: "What did the AI do this week that made me correct it?" Add a line to your instructions that would have prevented that correction. That's how the instructions become genuinely yours.

## Portability

The base template, the actual instructions that describe you and how you want the AI to behave, is roughly the same across platforms. Only the wrapper changes. Keep your master version in one place (a notes app, your Git dotfiles, wherever) and treat each platform's config as a rendering of that master.

When a new platform arrives, you'll spend 10 minutes wrapping it, not 4 hours writing it.

## What NOT to put in custom instructions

- Sensitive credentials or API keys (custom instructions get logged by the vendor)
- Very long lists of "always do X, never do Y" (models satisfice, so pick your top 5)
- Contradictions (e.g., "be brief" and "always explain in detail")
- Anything you'd be embarrassed to have appear in a support ticket screenshot

## The AI fluency program

These starter packs support the [AI Fluency Program](../..), a Stage 1 → Stage 2 curriculum for going from novice to governed power user. If you haven't gone through Stage 1 yet, start there.
